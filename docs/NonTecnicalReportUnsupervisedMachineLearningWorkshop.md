# üçÑ Machine Learning Project Report: Mushroom Edibility Classification

## 1. Project Goal and Overview

The main objective of this project was to determine whether a mushroom is **edible** or **poisonous** using data science and machine learning techniques. We started with a raw dataset of mushroom characteristics and followed a standard pipeline: **data cleaning**, **preprocessing**, **exploratory analysis**, **dimensionality reduction (PCA)**, **unsupervised learning (K-Means)**, and finally, **supervised classification (Random Forest)**.

## 2. Preparing the Data (The Cleanup Phase)

Before any machine learning can happen, the data must be clean and organized.

| Competency | Action Taken | Why it Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Cleaning** | **Missing values** (represented by '?') were filled in with the most common value (mode). A feature with only **one unique value** (the 'p.2' feature) was **removed** as it provided no information. | Ensures the data is complete and every feature contributes unique information. |
| **Preprocessing** | All categorical codes (e.g., 'k' for black, 'e' for edible) were converted into **numerical columns** using **One-Hot Encoding** and **Label Encoding**. | Machine learning models only understand numbers. This step expanded our initial 22 columns to **116 numerical features**. |
| **Data Split** | The data was split into a **Training Set (67%)** and a **Testing Set (33%)**. | The model trains on the Training Set and is tested on unseen data (the Testing Set) to ensure it performs well in the real world. |

## 3. Exploring Data Structure and Complexity

With 116 features, the data is complex. We used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify and visualize it.

### A. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

PCA helps us find the most important combinations of features that capture the most variation in the data.

* **Visualization:** We reduced the data to just **two components** to create a 2D scatter plot, colored by the target (edible/poisonous). 
    * **Finding:** The plot showed large regions where the two mushroom types were perfectly separated, suggesting the classification task would be easy.
* **Information Retention:** We checked how many components are actually needed to keep $\mathbf{95\%}$ of the original information.
    * **Finding:** We still needed **109 out of the 116 components**. This means while the task is simple for a classifier, the features themselves are largely **non-redundant**. The complexity (116 features) is justified.

### B. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means)

We then used **K-Means clustering** (unsupervised learning) to see how the data naturally groups itself, without using the 'edible/poisonous' labels. 

* **Optimal Clusters:** The **Elbow Method** confirmed that $\mathbf{K=2}$ clusters were most appropriate (matching our two target classes).
* **Finding:** When plotting the clusters against the true labels, the K-Means groups were highly **mixed** ($\approx 50/50$ split) .
* **Implication:** This shows that the factors that make a mushroom edible/poisonous **do not perfectly align** with the factors that make the mushroom features *look* similar. This is where a supervised model excels.

## 4. Supervised Classification and Final Results

We chose the **Random Forest** model‚Äîan Ensemble Method known for accuracy‚Äîto classify the mushrooms.

| Competency | Model Used | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Classification Model** | **Random Forest Classifier** (trained on standardized features) | **Test Accuracy: $\mathbf{1.0000}$ (100%)** |
| **Performance Check** | Retrained Random Forest using the $\mathbf{109}$ PCA components. | **Test Accuracy: $\mathbf{1.0000}$ (100%)** |

### Conclusion

The **Random Forest** model achieved **perfect accuracy** ($\mathbf{100\%}$) in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. This confirms that even though the dataset has many features, there is a **strong, clean signal** within the data that allows for flawless separation. The model is highly reliable for this classification task.
